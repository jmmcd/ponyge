# Introduction #

Grammatical evolution (GE) is an evolutionary algorithm which uses
formal grammars, written in BNF, to define the search space. PonyGE is
a small (one`*` source file!) but functional implementation of GE in Python. It's intended as
an advertisement and a starting-point for those new to GE, a reference
for implementors and researchers, a rapid-prototyping medium for our
own experiments, and a Python workout. And a pony.

See the [Installation](Installation.md) page. There's a README in the source distribution, and there's a [poster](http://code.google.com/p/ponyge/downloads/detail?name=evolutionary-art-poster.pdf&can=2&q=) for download.
