# Dependencies #

Python would be handy.
If you want to run the GUI for interactively evolving graphics, you also need Tk. It's installed by default on most systems.

## Ubuntu ##

For Python2, run:

`$ sudo apt-get install python-tk idle-python2.6`

For Python3, run:

`$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-tk`

## Other Linux distros ##

You know what to do.

## Mac ##

Python3 is preferred. Get it from
the [official download page](http://www.python.org/download).  If you don't want to install Python3, you can try using Python2, which is pre-installed on the Mac. Some people observe a
bug with it in which some mouse-clicks have no effect. Let us know. In either case, Tk will be installed along with it.

## Windows ##

Get Python 2 or 3 from the [official download page](http://www.python.org/download). Tk will be installed along with it.
