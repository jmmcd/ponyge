Grammatical evolution (GE) is an evolutionary algorithm which uses formal grammars, written in BNF, to define the search space. PonyGE is a small (one source file!) but functional implementation of GE in Python. It's intended as an advertisement and a starting-point for those new to GE, a reference for implementors and researchers, a rapid-prototyping medium for our own experiments, and a Python workout. And a pony.
